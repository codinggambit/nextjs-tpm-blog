    Tracker – A detailed work break-down of the project into a backlog of requirements for the entire project, and prioritized backlogs for every iteration, typically maintained in tools like Jira and Confluence. This should include dashboards, visualizations and reports to track key metrics (project metrics, customer metrics and product metrics)
    Communication artefacts – Preparation of documents/presentations/spreadsheets to keep the team apprised of project progress, blockers, risks and mitigations. 

Stakeholders

    Product – The Product Manager is the key member of who sets the vision for the product and is accountable for the success, adoption and evolution of the product. The TPM must work closely with the Product Manager on backlogs, prioritization, sprint planning, release planning, launch and post-launch activities.
    Engineering – Members of the engineering team who are responsible for the architecture, development, testing, deployment and release of the product. The TPM must work closely with the Engineering team on estimation, sprint planning, release planning, testing and release.
    Leadership – Stakeholders from the leadership and management team who are executive sponsors for the program/project. The TPM must keep the leadership team updated on the progress of projects/programs, risks and mitigation plans, and seek sponsorship and support as and when required.
    Business – Cross-functional stakeholders from peer teams that have inputs into or are impacted by the outcomes of the program/project, like UI/UX Design, Sales, Marketing, Customer Success, Operations, Legal, and Alpha & Beta Customers. The TPM must keep business teams updated on the progress of projects/programs, risks, mitigation plans, support required, launch preparedness, training plan for business teams, and planning and execution of post-launch activities.
