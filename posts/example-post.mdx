What To Expect In A Technical Program Manager Interview?

Having “outgrown” working the more technical aspects of a job, program-management candidates are ready to take on broader responsibilities. In short, they need just enough technical knowledge to understand how to make sound judgments regarding project estimates, resources, and risks, but they shouldn’t get so far into the weeds of technology that they’re mistaken for engineers or developers.

Job expectations often depend on the seniority of the role itself and the size of the department or organization. Still, there are basic questions common to TPM candidates, regardless. These might include:

    “Can you walk me through the process of designing an e-commerce platform?”
    “Can you describe a time when you made a decision that affected the architecture of the system?”
    “Share your best experience with regard to problem-solving. What was your involvement?”
    “How will you define milestones and communicate them to all stakeholders?”
    “How will you identify risk, and how will you mitigate it? What are the different ways of identifying risks?”
    “What would you do if a specific project is failing or if it won’t meet the deadlines?”
    “How would you update 10,000+ servers in a real-world scenario without impacting the end customers?”
    “What are the important elements of each project phase?”
    “How will you kick off a new project?”
